# better-workspace-mcp Handover

## Ownership and scope

`better-workspace-mcp` is a TypeScript MCP server for Google Workspace. The operational surface is this repository and its published package `@n24q02m/better-workspace-mcp`. OCI VM infrastructure, user-owned OMP profiles, scheduled synchronization, and stable-promotion decisions are outside this pack.

The server supports two transports:

- **stdio**: one local user, loopback Desktop OAuth, encrypted local credential storage.
- **HTTP**: multiple callers, Google Web OAuth, credential storage isolated by authenticated JWT `sub`; each caller can select one of that caller's configured Google accounts.

## Current service/tool inventory

The MCP registry exposes one composite tool per domain plus `config` and `help`:

| Tool | Operations | Output/pagination controls |
|---|---|---|
| `docs` | getText, create, writeText, getSuggestions, replaceText, formatText | `getText` defaults to 20,000 characters; `preview` uses 2,000 unless `limit` is supplied; `limit` accepts 1–100,000 and marks truncation explicitly. Writes return bounded status/IDs. |
| `drive` | findFolder, createFolder, search, trashFile, renameFile, getComments, moveFile, downloadFile | `search` uses `pageSize` and `pageToken`; downloads write to an explicitly selected local path. |
| `calendar` | listCalendars, createEvent, listEvents, getEvent, deleteEvent, updateEvent, respondToEvent, findFreeTime | Event listing uses time windows and page tokens where supported; free-time uses explicit time range and duration. |
| `gmail` | search, get, downloadAttachment, modify, batchModify, modifyThread, send, createDraft, sendDraft, listLabels, createLabel | Search defaults to a bounded `maxResults`; `pageToken` continues reads; message `format` selects payload size. |
| `sheets` | getText, getRange, getMetadata | Reads are range-scoped; callers choose the requested spreadsheet/range. |
| `slides` | presentation and slide/text/shape/image/table/notes operations | Metadata and range-like operations are resource-scoped; downloads require an explicit destination. |
| `tasks` | listTaskLists, listTasks, createTask, updateTask, completeTask, deleteTask | List calls support bounded `maxResults` and `pageToken`. |
| `chat` | listSpaces, findSpaceByName, setUpSpace, getMessages, listThreads, sendMessage, sendDm, findDmByEmail | Message/thread reads support `pageSize` and `pageToken`. |
| `people` | getMe, getUserProfile, getUserRelations | Profile lookups are resource-scoped. |
| `forms` | create, get, batchUpdate, listResponses, getResponse | `listResponses` supports `pageSize`, `pageToken`, and `filter`. |
| `time` | getCurrentTime, getTimeZone | Local-only; no Google account required. |
| `config` | status, setup_start, setup_reset, setup_complete, set, account_add, account_list, account_remove, account_set_default | Account lists are per caller and bounded by the configured credential store. |
| `help` | topic documentation | Reads one allowlisted Markdown topic at a time. |

The authoritative runtime registry is `src/tools/domains/index.ts`; `src/tools/registry.ts` derives tool definitions, help topics, resources, and dispatch from that list. Do not add a second inventory.

## Build, test, and run

```sh
bun install
bun run check
bun run test
bun run build
```

`bun run type-check` checks both the server TypeScript project and the Cloudflare worker project. `bun run build` produces `build/` and `bin/cli.mjs`. CI is the authoritative source for hosted checks; local commands are source evidence only.

For local stdio operation, provide `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` for a Desktop OAuth client. For HTTP operation, provide the Web client pair, `CREDENTIAL_SECRET`, and an exact `PUBLIC_URL`; set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in a container. `MCP_RELAY_PASSWORD` protects the hosted authorization entry point when configured. Never commit these values.

## Auth and isolation invariants

- HTTP credential storage is keyed by authenticated caller `sub`, then contains that caller's Google accounts.
- A requested account that is not configured is an error; it never silently falls back to the primary account.
- `account_add` uses a loopback callback in stdio and a fixed `/accounts/callback` route in HTTP.
- Remote OAuth state is signed, single-use, subject-bound, and carries no authority to change the default account.
- OAuth callback HTML escapes untrusted values, including backticks, before rendering.
- Tests use isolated temporary stores and hermetic protocol fixtures; real Google consent is a manual smoke scenario, not a CI test.

## Release and rollback

Releases are dispatched from `.github/workflows/cd.yml` with the repository's semantic-release workflow. Verify the exact source commit, workflow run/job conclusions, package version, tag OID, release asset, and published package metadata separately. A source merge or package asset alone is not runtime evidence. Stable promotion remains a separate group-wide decision.

Rollback is forward-only through a reviewed source change and a new release. Do not hand-create tags or rewrite published versions. If a release workflow fails after publication activity, preserve the exact run/job IDs and inspect provider state before retrying.

## Restructure and modernization map

1. Keep domain operations in the existing service/domain modules; adapters must not call each other or create a second credential store.
2. Preserve `src/tools/domains/index.ts` as the registry source of truth. Add a domain by extending its `DomainDef`, action list, input properties, and matching documentation.
3. Pagination controls for Drive, Gmail, Chat, Tasks, and Forms use a default of 20 and clamp caller values to 1–100; explicit continuation tokens remain available. Docs `getText` uses an explicit 20,000-character default, 2,000-character preview, and 1–100,000 `limit` bound with truncation markers.
4. Keep vendored service files aligned with upstream unless a local fork is recorded in `NOTICE` and covered by the sync test.
5. Treat package name, repository identity, MCP server ID, OAuth identity, data path, and endpoint as independent migration surfaces. No rename is implied by this handover.

### First week

- Run `bun run check`, `bun run test`, and `bun run build` from a clean worktree.
- Exercise the hermetic stdio and multi-account protocol tests.
- Review open PRs individually; reject duplicate bot proposals and exclude `.jules` trace files from product commits.
- For any auth change, rerun account isolation and callback escaping tests.

### Weeks 2–3

- Reverify the current published artifact against the exact source OID.
- Run the real supported domain round trip only with an isolated test account and explicit cleanup.
- Measure tool-list size and representative output sizes before changing caps; preserve page-token semantics.
- Review dependency and workflow updates with their exact CI conclusions.

### Months 1–3

- Pilot any domain API/CLI parity on one operation family before broader adapter work.
- Produce an exact file, caller, data-path, registry, OAuth, and rollback map before any identity migration.
- Keep provider spend, hosted deployment, and stable promotion behind their respective point-of-risk controls.
