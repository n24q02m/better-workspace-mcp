/**
 * How long the temporary server outlives a SUCCESSFUL consent.
 *
 * A second consent tab is ordinary. The user clicks the URL twice, the browser prefetches
 * it, they reload the finished page -- and during first-run setup mcp-core auto-opens one
 * itself while the URL printed to stderr offers another. Each tab runs its own PKCE
 * handshake and comes back to `/callback` with its own code (mcp-core keys pending sessions
 * on a per-tab nonce, so a late one is still valid), so closing the moment the FIRST tab
 * succeeds drops the second onto a dead port. Seen in the field: one tab on "Setup
 * complete", the other ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED at 127.0.0.1:<port>/callback -- an error page
 * for a consent that actually worked.
 *
 * Ten seconds is a round number, not a measured one. It covers the mechanical duplicates
 * above, which are all sub-second; it does not pretend to cover someone who finishes a
 * second tab a minute later. Covering that would mean not closing on success at all and
 * letting the flow's own deadline do it, which holds a port for minutes after a completed
 * consent.
 *
 * What a late tab may DO is the other half of this, and it stays in each flow's
 * `onTokenReceived`: the first consent writes, a later one for the same account is accepted
 * and writes nothing, a later one for a different account is refused. A window where any
 * tab could write would trade this error page for a silently added account.
