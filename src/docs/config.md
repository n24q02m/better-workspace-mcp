# config

Manage server configuration, Google credential state, and the set of Google
accounts this server can act as. Does not require a configured Google account --
works independently of the domain tools.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | Returns `{state, configured, accounts, primary}` -- the credential state (`awaiting_setup` \| `configured`), the configured account emails, and which one is primary. |
| `setup_start` | Returns instructions to trigger the browser Google OAuth consent flow (stdio mode: restart the server). |
| `setup_reset` | Clears stored credentials for **every** account and returns to `awaiting_setup`. |
| `setup_complete` | Re-checks stored credentials after an external config change. |
| `set` | No mutable runtime settings -- returns an informational no-op. |
| `cache_clear` | No client-side cache -- returns an informational no-op. |
| `account_add` | Starts a browser consent flow for one more Google account. Returns `{open, next, default_account}`; open the `open` URL to complete the consent. Works in stdio and HTTP. |
| `account_list` | Returns `{accounts, primary}`. |
| `account_remove` | Forgets the account named in `account`. Returns `{removed, primary}`. |
| `account_set_default` | Makes the account named in `account` the primary one. Returns `{primary}`. |

## Accounts

Every domain tool takes `account="<email>"`. Omit it and the call runs against
the primary account.

- The first account stored becomes the primary automatically.
- Removing the primary promotes one of the remaining accounts -- `account_remove`
  reports which one in `primary`.
- Removing the last account clears the credential blob and puts the server back
  in `awaiting_setup`; domain tools are refused again until an account is
  configured.
- Naming an account that is not configured is an **error that names the
  account**, and lists what is configured. The call is never silently rerouted to
  the primary -- a silent fallback would act on the wrong mailbox.
- Emails are the account keys, matched case-insensitively and stored lowercased.
- `account_remove` and `account_set_default` require `account` and have no
  default: falling back to the primary would remove or reshuffle the wrong
  account. `account_set_default` on an unknown account is an error.

### account_add

- Works in **both** transports, and picks the flow for you. In stdio it stands a
  temporary consent server on a loopback port; over HTTP it hands you a URL that
  comes back to a fixed `/accounts/callback` on the running server, because a
  Web OAuth client's redirect URI has to be registered in advance.
- **What that means for an HTTP deployment**: `<PUBLIC_URL>/accounts/callback`
  must be one of the redirect URIs registered on the Google **Web** OAuth client
  the server runs with. It is a second URI, separate from the
  `<PUBLIC_URL>/callback` used to sign in to the server itself -- registering only
  the latter leaves `account_add` failing at Google with
  `redirect_uri_mismatch`, after the consent screen rather than before it. Both
  are built from `PUBLIC_URL`, so that value has to be the exact public origin;
  Google compares redirect URIs as strings.
- The account that gets added is filed under **you**, not under whoever the
  consent screen was signed in as. Those are two different identities: the caller
  is identified by the `sub` in the token that authenticated this tool call, and
  the account by the email in the tokens Google returns. The `sub` travels to the
  callback in a signed, single-use state parameter, so nobody else's bucket can
  receive the account -- and the state carries no authority to move your default
  account, which is why `value="primary"` is stdio only.
- Requires `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in the
  environment. The HTTP flow also needs `PUBLIC_URL` and `CREDENTIAL_SECRET`.
- Returns the URL immediately rather than blocking on the consent. Open it, sign
  in as the account you want to add, then call `account_list` to confirm the
  outcome.
- Which account gets added is decided by whom you sign in as on the consent
  screen. `account_add` does **not** read the `account` parameter.
- Pass `value="primary"` to make the newly added account the primary one. This
  is **stdio only**: over HTTP the request would have to travel in the URL and
  back through Google, where anyone who obtained it could point your default at
  an account of theirs. Remote callers get told it was ignored and should use
  `account_set_default` instead. (Either way, the very first account in an empty
  store becomes primary -- a store of accounts with no working default would be
  broken.)
- The link is good for 10 minutes and works once. In stdio the temporary consent
  server also closes itself after that window, so an abandoned flow does not hold
  its port open. Call `account_add` again if the URL has gone stale.

## key / value

`key` is accepted on the schema but unused. `value` is read only by `account_add`
(`value="primary"`).

## Upgrading from the single-account layout

Credentials written before multi-account support are a single flat blob of tokens.
The first run afterwards adopts that blob into the multi-account layout, keyed by
the account's email:

- The email comes from the stored `id_token` when it is there. That needs no
  network and is the usual case.
- Otherwise the server asks Google's userinfo endpoint, which needs network
  access and a token that is still valid or refreshable.

If neither works, the state falls back to `awaiting_setup` and the server starts the
browser OAuth flow even though the stored token may still be good. Completing that
consent does work, and nothing is discarded: the newly authorized account is stored
and becomes the primary, and the old blob is carried across under the key
`(unidentified)` rather than being overwritten. `account_list` then shows two
entries:

```json
{ "accounts": ["(unidentified)", "you@example.com"], "primary": "you@example.com" }
```

`(unidentified)` holds the tokens whose owner could not be determined. Nothing
routes to it -- it is never promoted to primary while a real account remains, and
no call can select it unless you name it. Remove it once the re-authorized account
is working:

```json
{ "action": "account_remove", "account": "(unidentified)" }
```

After a successful adoption -- the usual case -- `account_list` shows exactly one
account and it is the primary.
